# Wordle-Standard-Output
This was a project I did in order to practice some of my C++ knowledge in a fun way.
This was written purely in C++ and adds a extra features that are not present in the original game such as a hint system and an option to adjust difficulty

# Build and Run
You can use your IDE of choice to run this project. I personally utilized NetBeans but anyhting should work.
